In Flutter/Dart, you can listen to changes in SharedPreferences using the SharedPreferences package and the StreamController class.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to create a stream that emits the current value of a SharedPreferences key whenever it changes:
```
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

class SharedPreferencesStream {
  final String _key;
  final StreamController<String> _controller;
  SharedPreferences _prefs;

  SharedPreferencesStream(this._key)
      : _controller = StreamController<String>.broadcast() {
    SharedPreferences.getInstance().then((prefs) {
      _prefs = prefs;
      _prefs.getString(_key)?.let((value) => _controller.add(value));
      _prefs.onChanged.listen(_onPrefsChanged);
    });
  }

  Stream<String> get stream => _controller.stream;

  void _onPrefsChanged(String key) {
    if (key == _key) {
      _prefs.getString(_key)?.let((value) => _controller.add(value));
    }
  }

  void dispose() {
    _controller.close();
  }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a `SharedPreferencesStream` class that takes the SharedPreferences key we want to listen to as a constructor parameter. We then create a StreamController that will broadcast the current value of the key whenever it changes.

When the SharedPreferencesStream is instantiated, we use the *`SharedPreferences.getInstance()`* method to get the SharedPreferences instance and save it to the _prefs field. We then use the let() method (which is part of the dartx package) to check if the key already has a value in SharedPreferences and add it to the stream if it does.

Finally, we use the onChanged stream of the SharedPreferences instance to listen for changes to the key. When a change is detected, we check if the key that changed is the one we're listening to, and if it is, we add the new value to the stream.

To use this class, you can create an instance of SharedPreferencesStream with the key you want to listen to, and then listen to its stream:

```
SharedPreferencesStream myStream = SharedPreferencesStream("my_key");
myStream.stream.listen((value) {
  // Do something with the new value
});
```

Remember to call dispose() on the SharedPreferencesStream when you're done listening to the stream to avoid memory leaks:
```
myStream.dispose();
```

how do I use that with streambuilder?
To use the SharedPreferencesStream with a StreamBuilder widget in Flutter, you can simply pass the stream from the SharedPreferencesStream instance to the StreamBuilder widget's stream parameter.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use StreamBuilder with the SharedPreferencesStream class:

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

class SharedPreferencesStream {
  // ... implementation of SharedPreferencesStream as shown in previous answer

  Stream<String> get stream => _controller.stream;
}

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  SharedPreferencesStream _myStream;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _myStream = SharedPreferencesStream("my_key");
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _myStream.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StreamBuilder<String>(
      stream: _myStream.stream,
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.hasData) {
          // Do something with the data
          return Text(snapshot.data);
        } else {
          // Show a loading indicator or placeholder
          return CircularProgressIndicator();
        }
      },
    );
  }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create an instance of SharedPreferencesStream in the initState() method of the MyApp widget. We also dispose of the stream in the dispose() method to avoid memory leaks.

Then, in the build() method of the MyApp widget, we use a StreamBuilder widget to listen to the stream from the SharedPreferencesStream instance. We pass the stream to the stream parameter of the StreamBuilder widget and provide a builder function that takes a snapshot of the stream's data.

Inside the builder function, we check if the snapshot has data using the hasData property. If it does, we can use the data to build the UI, such as by returning a Text widget with the data as its text. If the snapshot doesn't have data, we can show a loading indicator or placeholder widget, such as a CircularProgressIndicator.

By using StreamBuilder with SharedPreferencesStream, you can easily build reactive UIs that automatically update whenever the value of a SharedPreferences key changes.
